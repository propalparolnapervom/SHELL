-- is greater than or equal to
if [ "$a" -ge "$b" ]

-- is less than
if [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]

-- is less than or equal to

-- is less than (within double parentheses)
(("$a" < "$b"))

(("$a" <= "$b"))

-- is greater than (within double parentheses)
(("$a" > "$b"))

-- is greater than or equal to (within double parentheses)
(("$a" >= "$b"))




  -- COMPARISON (string)

-- BOOLEAN

    OR and AND for commands in shell
|| and && 

    OR and AND like parameter
-o и -a

-- is equal to
if [ "$a" = "$b" ]
   Caution	
   Note the whitespace framing the =.
   if [ "$a"="$b" ] is not equivalent to the above.

-- is equal to
if [ "$a" == "$b" ]
   This is a synonym for =.
   Note	
   The == comparison operator behaves differently within a double-brackets test than within single    brackets.
   [[ $a == z* ]]   # True if $a starts with an "z" (pattern matching).
   [[ $a == "z*" ]] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching).
   [ $a == z* ]     # File globbing and word splitting take place.
   [ "$a" == "z*" ] # True if $a is equal to z* (literal matching).

-- is not equal to
if [ "$a" != "$b" ]
   This operator uses pattern matching within a [[ ... ]] construct.

-- is less than, in ASCII alphabetical order
if [[ "$a" < "$b" ]]
if [ "$a" \< "$b" ]
   Note that the "<" needs to be escaped within a [ ] construct.

-- is greater than, in ASCII alphabetical order
if [[ "$a" > "$b" ]]
if [ "$a" \> "$b" ]
   Note that the ">" needs to be escaped within a [ ] construct.

-- string is null, that is, has zero length
String=''   # Zero-length ("null") string variable.
if [ -z "$String" ]
then
  echo "\$String is null."
else
  echo "\$String is NOT null."
fi     # $String is null.

-- string is not null.

  -- CONCAT

a='hello'

c=$a$b

foo="Hello"

  -- FILE TEST OPERATORS

-e
file exists

-a
file exists
   This is identical in effect to -e. It has been "deprecated," [1] and its use is discouraged.

-f
file is a regular file (not a directory or device file)

-s
file is not zero size

-d
file is a directory

-b
file is a block device


-c
file is a character device
 device0="/dev/sda2"    # /   (root directory)
 if [ -b "$device0" ]
 then
   echo "$device0 is a block device."
 fi
 # /dev/sda2 is a block device.
 device1="/dev/ttyS1"   # PCMCIA modem card.
 if [ -c "$device1" ]
 then
   echo "$device1 is a character device."
 fi
 # /dev/ttyS1 is a character device.

-p
file is a pipe
 function show_input_type()
 {
    [ -p /dev/fd/0 ] && echo PIPE || echo STDIN
 }
 show_input_type "Input"                           # STDIN
 echo "Input" | show_input_type                    # PIPE

-h
file is a symbolic link

-L
file is a symbolic link

-S
file is a socket

-t
file (descriptor) is associated with a terminal device
   This test option may be used to check whether the stdin [ -t 0 ] or stdout [ -t 1 ] in a given    script is a terminal.

-r
file has read permission (for the user running the test)

-w
file has write permission (for the user running the test)

-x
file has execute permission (for the user running the test)

-g
set-group-id (sgid) flag set on file or directory
   If a directory has the sgid flag set, then a file created within that directory belongs to the group    that owns the directory, not necessarily to the group of the user who created the file. This may be    useful for a directory shared by a workgroup.

-u
set-user-id (suid) flag set on file
   A binary owned by root with set-user-id flag set runs with root privileges, even when an ordinary    user invokes it. [2] This is useful for executables (such as pppd and cdrecord) that need to access    system hardware. Lacking the suid flag, these binaries could not be invoked by a non-root user.
	      -rwsr-xr-t    1 root       178236 Oct  2  2000 /usr/sbin/pppd     
   A file with the suid flag set shows an s in its permissions.

-k
sticky bit set
   Commonly known as the sticky bit, the save-text-mode flag is a special type of file permission. If a    file has this flag set, that file will be kept in cache memory, for quicker access. [3] If set on a    directory, it restricts write permission. Setting the sticky bit adds a t to the permissions on the    file or directory listing. This restricts altering or deleting specific files in that directory to      the owner of those files.
	      drwxrwxrwt    7 root         1024 May 19 21:26 tmp/     
   If a user does not own a directory that has the sticky bit set, but has write permission in that    directory, she can only delete those files that she owns in it. This keeps users from inadvertently    overwriting or deleting each other's files in a publicly accessible directory, such as /tmp. (The       owner of the directory or root can, of course, delete or rename files there.)

-O
you are owner of file

-G
group-id of file same as yours

-N
file modified since it was last read

f1 -nt f2
file f1 is newer than f2

f1 -ot f2
file f1 is older than f2

f1 -ef f2
files f1 and f2 are hard links to the same file

!
"not" -- reverses the sense of the tests above (returns true if condition absent).

Exit Code Number	Meaning	Example	Comments
1	Catchall for general errors	let "var1 = 1/0"	Miscellaneous errors, such as "divide by zero" and other impermissible operations
2	Misuse of shell builtins (according to Bash documentation)	empty_function() {}	Missing keyword or command, or permission problem (and diff return code on a failed binary file comparison).
126	Command invoked cannot execute	/dev/null	Permission problem or command is not an executable
127	"command not found"	illegal_command	Possible problem with $PATH or a typo
128	Invalid argument to exit	exit 3.14159	exit takes only integer args in the range 0 - 255 (see first footnote)
128+n	Fatal error signal "n"	kill -9 $PPID of script	$? returns 137 (128 + 9)
130	Script terminated by Control-C	Ctl-C	Control-C is fatal error signal 2, (130 = 128 + 2, see above)
